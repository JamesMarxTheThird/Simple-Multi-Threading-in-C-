# Simple-Multi-Threading-in-C-

Background:

This C# console application shows a simple way to create threads. When multiple treads are created, they can be allocated to call certain methods. Then, depending on your desired output or outcome you can call the threads appropriately.

They could be called in a certain order following events, or like in this example called together. This runs all 3 threads simultaneously which could contain any code. Running different sets of code simultaenously can help speed up and optimize your software.

A very simple C# console applicaiton demonstrating the process of 3 threads running simultaneously.

Getting Started:

Screenshots of the output are shown below as well as some source code to understand this output.

The app can run on Visual studios 2019 or 2022.

Usage:

I aim to add these techniques to the web applicaitons we have been creating in class. In the hopes
of optimizing it and making pages and functions load as fast as possible.

Setting methods that the threads will call:

The output after the threads have all ran, and thread 2 has 'slept':
